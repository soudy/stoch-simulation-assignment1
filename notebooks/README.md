# Stochastic Simulations Assignment 1: Notebooks
This directory contains the notebooks in which we run all our experiments and do
all our visualizations.
The files in this folder contain the following:
- `Mandelbrot_Monte_Carlo.ipynb` contains the code for the main results: Monte
  Carlo simulations, statistical analysis, and visualizations are done in this
  notebook (Section 3.2 to 3.4 in the report).
- `Mandelbrot_visualization.ipynb` contains the code used for visualizing the
  Mandelbrot set (Section 3.1 in the report).
- `RNG visualizations.ipynb` visualizes the different types of sampling methods
  described in Section 2.3 of the report.
- `helpers.py` contains helper functions for multiprocessing and sampling methods.
- `orthogonal_sampler.py` contains our implementation of orthogonal sampling.
